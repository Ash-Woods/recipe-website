        <h3>How to make!</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><input type="checkbox">Put the porcini mushrooms into a smallbowl, pour over with 1 cup of boiling water, and set aside.</li>
            <li><input type="checkbox">Heat the oil in a wide, tall-sided frying pan or casserole over a medium heat. Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and saute for 10 minutes. Stir the rice in well and cook gently for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><input type="checkbox">Strain the soaked porcini into a small pan, storing the soaking liquid from the porcini, and add the strained porcini to the rice mixture.</li>
            <li><input type="checkbox">Pour the wine into the porcini soaking liquid, place over a medium heat and bring to a boil, then turn down to a very low simmer.</li>
            <li><input type="checkbox">Ladle '1 1/4' cups of the hot wine and soaking liquid (porcini) into the rice. Cook, stirring constantly, until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid. Ladle another '1 1/4 cups' of the hot wine and soaking liquid into the rice and keep stirring until it has been absorbed.</li>
            <li><input type="checkbox">Add the chestnut mushrooms to the rice, then ladle in '1 1/4 cups' more ofthe hot wine and soaking liquid, stirring until absorbed, until there's no additional hot wine/soaking liquid left, and the rice is plump and cooked through. This will take about 15 minutes, but do test it (by taking a small amount of rice on a separate spoon) as the rice can vary. Meanwhile, warm four wide serving bowls.</li>
            <li><input type="checkbox">Stir the salt and ground black pepper into the risotto along with most of the parsley. Leave to rest for a couple of minutes. Ladle the risotto into the warm bowls, sprinkle the parsley.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tip</h3>
        <p>Ensure that the soaking liquid and hot wine are mixed together, then start to mix noting that any additional mixture may require further salt/pepper due to a dilution of the rice mixture.</p>
        <p>When stirring in the liquid to the rice mixture, continue stirring periodically to avoid any rice mixture sticking to the bottom of the pan.</p>
